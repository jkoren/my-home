## MY HOME

My-Home is a responsive web application to help people better use the equipment in their life. Itâ€™s a site to store and share manuals and operating videos for all the appliances and other technology in their home. 

My-Home is built with JavaScript and React for the front-end, and Rails, Ruby and PostgreSQL for the back-end.  I used Devise for Authentication and Authorization,  and used both Dropzone and CarrierWave for file and image uploads.  My-Home stores images and documents on Amazon's AWS S3 Cloud Storage.

## Technology

This is a project I built for my Capstone project at Launch Academy.  Technology includes:
* React and Javascript on the front-end
* Rails, Ruby and PostgreSQL on the back end
* Formatting with HTML, CSS and the Foundation responsive front-end framework
* Images are mostly stored in an AWS bucket. 

It works in a standard or mobile browser.
